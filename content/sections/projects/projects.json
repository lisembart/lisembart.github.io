For this project, I implemented all the quests featured in the original version. I also modified the Kaer Morhen map to closely resemble its original layout. In addition, I integrated music from The Witcher 1 into The Witcher 3. I created all dialogue scenes and cutscenes from scratch. A significant amount of scripting was also involved—for example, the mod can be launched directly via a custom button in the game’s main menu. The project turned out to be much larger than I initially expected, and its development took a considerable amount of time.",
